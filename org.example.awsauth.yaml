    # Add any Python dependencies here that are not part of the runtime
    # boto3 is a dependency, so we need to ensure it's installed.
    # If boto3 is not part of the freedesktop runtime, it needs to be listed here.
    # For simplicity, we're letting pip install it from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
    # If you have a requirements.txt, you might do:
    # - pip install --prefix=/app -r requirements.txt
    # Or if using pyproject.toml, pip install . should handle it.
